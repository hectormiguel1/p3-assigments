|  Compile/Run:  [To compile use gcc as shown bellow. The -std=c99 is important,
|                   as it donates that this program uses the newer 1999 standard
|                   of C, otherwise ocelot compiler will default to 1989.]

|  Description:  [Program designed to take user input for n size steps and then
|                   prints the prints a table from 0 to 50 going up by n steps
|                   including information regarding the circle radius will go
|                   from 0 to 50, and computing Diameter, Circumference, and
|                   Area.   ]
|                  
|        Input: [Value from 1 to 9, indicates the size n to increase the radius by.]
|       Output: [Table containing the properties of the circle, scaling from 0 to 50 at size n]
|      Process: [Internally compute the values by calling the functions. For
|                   the range verification of the input we are using scanf to
|                   read the value into variable if it is not within range,
|                   reset and prompt again. This program also guards against
|                   characters being passed as input, at which point getchar is
|                   used to remove the offending character and re-prompting.  ]

|   Required Features Not Included:[All features are working as expected.]

|   Known Bugs:  [No known bugs]
